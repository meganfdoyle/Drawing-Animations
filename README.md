In this project, I created a timer that counts down from the time specified with a default of three seconds. The amount of time can be changed by clicking the middle of the circle above the play and pause buttons. The border of the circle decreases in a clockwise motion until the timer has reached 0. The CSS was copied from Stephen Grider's section of The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course.
